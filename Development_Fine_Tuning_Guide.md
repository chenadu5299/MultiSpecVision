# MultiSpecVision Development & Fine-Tuning Guide

This document provides guidance for secondary development and model fine-tuning based on the MultiSpecVision architecture.

---

## Approach 1: MultiSpecVision Secondary Development Recommendations

### 1. Understanding Project Structure
- Read `Architecture_Documentation.md` to clarify the roles of core models, entries, configurations, and utility files.
- Focus on model implementation files in the `models/` directory (such as `swin_transformer.py`, `swin_transformer_v2.py`).

### 2. Extending Based on Existing Architecture
- For **new tasks or domains**, recommend modifying classification heads, attention mechanisms, and other parts based on existing models.
- Modify or extend Transformer Block, Attention mechanism, window partitioning, etc., based on `models/swin_transformer.py`.
- Can create new model files, implementing following the pattern of `swin_transformer.py`.

### 3. Modifying Configuration Files
- Create new or modify yaml configuration files in the `configs/` directory, specifying model structure, training parameters, data paths, etc.
- Reference existing configuration file formats, for example `configs/swin/swin_tiny_patch4_window7_224.yaml`.

### 4. Data Processing
- Modify data loading code in the `data/` directory according to specific tasks.
- For multi-channel data, reference `models/dng_processor.py` and `models/multi_channel_swin_transformer.py`.

### 5. Training and Evaluation
- Use `main.py` as the main entry for training/evaluation.
- If custom training processes are needed, modify based on `main.py`.

## Approach 2: MultiSpecVision Fine-tuning Solution

### 1. Download Pre-trained Models
- Visit `MODELHUB.md` or official README to download appropriate `.pth` weight files (such as `swin_base_patch4_window7_224.pth`).
- Weight files are usually available on the project's GitHub Release page or cloud storage like OneDrive.

### 2. Prepare Dataset
- Prepare your target dataset, organized in ImageNet format (training set, validation set, etc.).
- Ensure data paths are correctly set in configuration files.

### 3. Configure Fine-tuning Parameters
- In directories like `configs/swin/`, select or create new yaml configuration files with `finetune` in the name.
- Typical fine-tuning configuration files include: `swin_base_patch4_window7_224_22kto1k_finetune.yaml`.
- Main parameters to adjust:
  - `MODEL.NUM_CLASSES`: Number of classes for target task
  - `DATA.DATA_PATH`: Dataset path
  - `TRAIN.LR`: Learning rate (usually 10x smaller than training from scratch)
  - `TRAIN.EPOCHS`: Training epochs
  - `TRAIN.WEIGHT_DECAY`: Weight decay

### 4. Start Fine-tuning
```bash
python main.py \
--cfg configs/swin/your_finetune_config.yaml \
--pretrained pretrained_weights.pth \
--data-path dataset_path
```

### 5. Monitoring and Adjustment
- Use tools like TensorBoard to monitor training process.
- Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate and training epochs based on validation set performance.

## Approach 3: Multi-channel MultiSpecVision Development

### 1. Multi-channel Model Design
- Develop based on `models/multi_channel_swin_transformer.py`.
- Support dynamic input adjustment for 3-20 channels.

### 2. Multi-sensor Data Processing
- Implement preprocessing pipelines for different sensors.
- Support various imaging modes including RGB, multispectral, thermal imaging, X-ray, etc.

### 3. Segmentation Task Extension
- Modify model output layers to support semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and other tasks.
- Reference segmentation implementation in `multi_channel_app.py`.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Q1: How to handle class number mismatch?
**A**: Modify the model's final classification head:
```python
# Assuming pre-trained model has 1000 classes, your task has 10 classes
model.head = nn.Linear(model.head.in_features, 10)
```

### Q2: How to handle insufficient memory?
**A**:
- Reduce `TRAIN.BATCH_SIZE`
- Enable `TRAIN.USE_CHECKPOINT` (gradient checkpointing)
- Use mixed precision training (AMP)

### Q3: How to modify input resolution?
**A**:
- Modify `DATA.IMG_SIZE` in configuration file
- Select pre-trained weights for corresponding resolution
- Or use position embedding interpolation

### Q4: How to load RGB pre-trained weights for multi-channel models?
**A**:
```python
model.load_from("pretrained_weights.pth", in_chans=3)
# Model will automatically handle channel number adaptation
```

## Recommended Development Workflow

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Clarify task type (classification/segmentation/detection, etc.), data characteristics (channel count, resolution, etc.)
2. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate MultiSpecVision variant (Tiny/Small/Base/Large) based on requirements
3. **Data Preparation**: Process data format, split training/validation sets
4. **Configuration Adjustment**: Modify yaml configuration files, set appropriate hyperparameters
5. **Fine-tuning Training**: Use pre-trained weights for fine-tuning
6. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance on test set
7. **Deployment Optimization**: Perform model compression, quantization and other optimizations based on deployment environment

## Additional Resources

- **Original Papers**: Reference MultiSpecVision related papers to understand model principles
- **Community Discussion**: Follow GitHub Issues for problems and solutions
- **Pre-trained Models**: Regularly check for new pre-trained weight releases
- **Datasets**: Collect public datasets in related domains for training and evaluation

Through the above approaches, you can choose appropriate development paths based on specific requirements and implement customized solutions based on MultiSpecVision.
